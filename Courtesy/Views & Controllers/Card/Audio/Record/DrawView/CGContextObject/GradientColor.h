 The number of items in this array should be the product of count and the number of components in the color space. For example, if the color space is an RGBA color space and you want to use two colors in the gradient (one for a starting location and another for an ending location), then you need to provide 8 values in componentsâ€”red, green, blue, and alpha values for the first color, followed by red, green, blue, and alpha values for the second color.
