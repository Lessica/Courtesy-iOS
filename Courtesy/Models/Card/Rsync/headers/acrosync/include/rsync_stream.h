// IMPORTANT NOTE:
//   To save developement time, this class only works on little-endian machines, as the rsync protocol transmits
// integers in little-endian format.  Conversion must be added if you want to port this class to big-endian machines.
//
// Blocking model:
// 
// - all reads and writes are all blocking
// - writeAll will try to fill the read buffer when it can't write
// - read will read from the read buffer first, and then from the stream until d_readDataLength is 0
// - write will write to the write buffer first.  If d_automaticFlush is on, it will call flushWriteBuffer when the
//   buffer is full.  Otherwise, it will never block and tryFlushWriteBuffer must be called frequently.
// - flushWriteBuffer is blocking
// - tryFlushWriteBuffer is non-blocking
//
// Potential deadlock scenario:
//
//   read is trying to complete, but the remote side has nothing to send because
//   data is still in the local write buffer and not yet flushed.  This can only happen
//   in download mode (in upload mode the remote side starts the stream).  So make sure
//   not to call read() unless the write buffer has been flushed.
